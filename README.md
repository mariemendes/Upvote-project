## Description

This project is a React-based application designed to implement a customizable upvote system with reusable components. The main objective is to create an upvote feature that toggles between two states—selected and not-selected—with clear visual indicators and efficient state management.

Initially, the project required only three containers, but I expanded it by adding new features:

- An "Add Container" button, allowing users to dynamically add as many containers as needed.
- A "Reset All" button, enabling users to reset all containers and upvotes to their default state.
- A "-" button, which allows users to remove the most recent upvote from any container.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created by Mariane Mendes as part of the technical assessment for the company Scrawlr. Through this project, I had the opportunity to dive back into React.js and JavaScript, while also learning a great deal about Jest.js. It was my first time working with test files, and I really enjoyed the process.

Thank you very much for the opportunity!
